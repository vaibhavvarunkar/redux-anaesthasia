          intended for physicians and other healthcare professionals. Updating
          certain information, including Current Procedural Terminology (CPTÂ®),

          licensors. While we hope you find the Services helpful, you should
          remember that it is not meant to serve as a substitute for your own
          clinical judgment as a healthcare professional and you should evaluate
          and independently verify the information and results from the Services
          we provide. We do not provide professional advice or recommend
          particular products through our Services. If you are a consumer who
          chooses to use the professional-level information available to you
          through the Services, you do so at your own risk and you should not
          rely on that information as professional medical advice or use it to
          replace any relationship with your physician or other qualified
          healthcare professional. Individuals with any type of medical
          condition are specifically cautioned to seek professional medical
          advice before beginning any sort of health treatment. For medical
          concerns, including decisions about medications and other treatments,
          consumers should always consult their physician or, in serious cases,
          seek immediate assistance from emergency personnel. The Anesthesia
          One' drug interaction checker included in the Services is based on
          two-drug combinations. The results returned by the checker reflect
          only paired interactions and compatibility and do not reflect
          interactions or incompatibilities arising from combinations of more
          than two drugs at a time.
