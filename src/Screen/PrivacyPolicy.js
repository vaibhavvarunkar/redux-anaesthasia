          affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the
          consumer who is at least 13 but not yet 16 years of age, or the parent
          or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who
          opt-in to Personal Information sales may opt-out of future sales at
          any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized
          representative) may submit a request to us: Emailing us at
          anesthesiaoneplus@gmail.com Once you make an opt-out request, we will
          wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize
          Personal Information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt
          back into Personal Information sales at any time by: Emailing us at
          anesthesiaoneplus@gmail.com We will only use Personal Information
          provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
          For Access, Data Portability, Deletion, or Sale Opt Out rights, we
          cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal
          Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the
          request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a
          verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account
          with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a
          verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or
          authority to make the request.

          We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within

          verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will
          also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if
          applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to
          provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should
          allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another
          entity without hindrance.
